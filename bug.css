The following CSS rule may lead to unexpected behavior in some browsers: `background-size: cover;`.  While seemingly straightforward, using `cover` without specifying exact dimensions for the background image or its container can result in inconsistent rendering across devices and browsers, especially when dealing with images of different aspect ratios.  The browser will stretch or crop the image to fully cover the container, but the cropping can be unpredictable.
